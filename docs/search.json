    "text": "1.1 Knowledge gain From the Lecture\n\nThis week’s learning journey into the realm of remote sensing, unveiling the intricate world of electromagnetic waves and their interactions with Earth’s surface. Remote sensing, as I’ve learned, involves acquiring information about objects or areas from a distance, typically from aircraft or satellites, and is a vital tool in understanding our planet.\n\n\n1.1.1 Foundational Concepts of Remote Sensing\n\nOne of the foundational concepts we explored was the difference between passive and active remote sensing. Passive remote sensing relies on natural energy, usually from the sun, whereas active remote sensing systems emit their own energy to illuminate objects. This distinction is crucial for understanding the varied applications of remote sensing technologies like LiDAR, radar, and satellite imagery in observing earth’s landscapes, urban areas, and atmospheric conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\nPassive & Active Remote Sensing, Source: Abeer Nazar Abdul-Hameed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.2 Electromagnetic Waves: Core of Remote Sensing\n\nMuch of our learning knowledge focused on electromagnetic waves, the heart of remote sensing. These waves, a form of energy that propagates through electric and magnetic fields, are the backbone of how remote sensors collect data. Remote sensing is based on this principle to detect the reflection of electromagnetic waves by surface objects and their emission of electromagnetic waves, so as to extract information about these objects and complete the identification of objects at a distance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Electromagnetic Spectrum, Source: Cssonawala\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.3 Interactions with Earth’s Surface\n\nWe have looked at the complexities of how electromagnetic radiation (EMR) interacts with the Earth’s surface. EMR can be absorbed, transmitted or scattered by the surface and atmosphere. Scattering, in particular, explains phenomena such as the blue colour of the sky or the blackness of the lunar sky due to the absence of an atmosphere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteraction of EMR with Earth’s Surface, Source: Geographicbook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.4 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and its Applications\n\nThe Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) was another fascinating topic. SAR’s ability to ‘see through clouds’ using longer wavelengths is revolutionary, offering a consistent observation capability irrespective of weather conditions. This technology’s potential in areas like topography, vegetation analysis, and urban planning is immense, showcasing how advanced remote sensing techniques can overcome environmental challenges\nThe study of SAR data also introduced us to the concept of polarization, a property of electromagnetic waves that describes their oscillation direction. This property is crucial for understanding how radar signals interact with different surface properties and is instrumental in enhancing the efficiency and bandwidth of communications.\n\n\n\n1.1.5 Technical Insights and Data Formats in Remote Sensing\n\nOn the technical side, we learned about the different data formats used in remote sensing, such as GeoTIFF, and the importance of resolutions - spatial, spectral, temporal and radiometric. These resolutions define the quality and type of data acquired, and influence how effectively we can interpret and use the data for various applications such as land cover mapping and environmental monitoring.\nIn the literature, these concepts are used to analyse environmental change, urban development and geological features. Understanding remote sensing data and their interpretation is essential for researchers and policy makers to make informed decisions."

    "text": "1.3 Reflecting From the Lecture\n\nReflecting on the week’s learning, I am struck by the profound impact that remote sensing has on our understanding of the world. The ability to observe and analyse our planet from a distance provides a unique perspective that is not possible through ground-based observations alone. It literally allows us to see the bigger picture, providing a comprehensive understanding of large-scale environmental patterns, urban development and even climate change.\nRemote sensing is interdisciplinary in nature. It’s not just a tool for geographers or environmental scientists; it integrates physics, engineering, environmental science and even policy-making. This integration demonstrates the collaborative effort required to address complex global issues. For example, remote sensing data can inform policies on urban planning, agricultural practices and disaster management, making it a critical tool for sustainable development.\nAnother aspect is the rapid evolution of remote sensing technology. With innovations such as high-resolution imagery and real-time data analysis, the potential applications of this technology are expanding at an incredible rate."

    "section": "3.1 Knowledge gain From the Lecture",
    "text": "3.1 Knowledge gain From the Lecture\n\nThis week’s study focuses on remote sensing image processing, with the main areas of interest being geometric corrections, atmospheric corrections, orthometric corrections, radiometric corrections and various image enhancement techniques.\n\n\n3.1.1 Correction\n\n3.1.1.1 Geometric Correction\n\nGeometric correction is the basis of image correction and addresses image distortion due to sensor and other factors. The goal of this correction is to make the image conform to the selected map projection system, adjusting the geometry of the entire image by modelling the relationship between control points (points with known geographic coordinates) on the image and the image coordinates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Geometric Correction Work, Source: Xiaopeng\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the above calibration process, it can be done by the following equation For a point ((x, y)) in the distorted image, the corresponding point ((x’, y’)) in the geometrically corrected image can be calculated using:\n\\[\nx' = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 y + a_3 x^2 + a_4 xy + a_5 y^2 + \\ldots\n\\] \\[\ny' = b_0 + b_1 x + b_2 y + b_3 x^2 + b_4 xy + b_5 y^2 + \\ldots\n\\]\nHere, (a_0, a_1, , a_n) and (b_0, b_1, , b_n) are coefficients determined through a calibration process using ground control points (GCPs), which are points whose true position is known. The number of terms in the polynomial (and thus the number of coefficients) depends on the degree of the polynomial required to model the distortion adequately. A first-degree polynomial correction (affine transformation) would not include the squared terms, for example.\n\n\n\n3.1.1.2 Atmospheric Correction\n\nAtmospheric corrections are essential to address distortions and inaccuracies in remotely sensed images caused by variations in the Earth’s atmosphere, sensor angles, and terrain. Several different correction methods were learned in class: Relative Atmospheric Correction, Pseudo-Invariant Correction, Absolute Atmospheric Correction, and Empirical Line Correction.\n\nThe different methods and characteristics of atmospheric correction have been summarised in the table below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod\nKey Steps\nFeature\n\n\n\n\nRelative\nSpectrally stable landmarks, linear relations, band operation\nConsistency between images\n\n\nAbsolute\nComplex models for atmospheric effects, surface reflectance\nPrecise, accurate surface information\n\n\nPseudo-Invariant\nHigh-quality reference, PIF, linear regression\nStable reference points, reduce atmospheric effects\n\n\nEmpirical Line\nGround reflectance, average DN values, linear regression\nUtilizes ground data for satellite correction\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.1.3 Radiometric Correction\n\nThe role of radiometric correction in adjusting the pixel values of satellite imagery to accurately reflect the radiation at the Earth’s surface has been investigated. The main objective of radiometric correction is to convert the raw digital numbers (DN) acquired into physically meaningful units such as radiance or reflectance. This conversion is critical because DN values are arbitrary and can vary between sensors, acquisitions and platforms, making it difficult to consistently compare and analyse data. By converting DN values to radiance or reflectance, radiometric correction enables quantitative measurements and meaningful comparisons between different images and sensors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess of Radiometric Calibration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.1.4 Reflection of Collerallation\n\nIn the course of study, certain questions arise as to when atmospheric corrections are needed and whether or not the images we buy or otherwise acquire have been atmospherically corrected. In layman’s terms, if we need to use an image that truly reflects the Sun’s radiation for quantitative inversion or to obtain information about the Earth, accurately identify features, etc., then we need to make an atmospheric correction. When we buy an image, the description document says that it is radiometrically corrected. In fact, this radiometric correction refers to the coarse radiometric correction, which is just a systematic atmospheric correction, which has the same meaning as the systematic geometric correction.\nAt the moment there are many models and methods on the market, since there are how many methods, then there is the problem of method selection. Here is a summary for reference:\n\nif it is a fine quantitative study, then choose the atmospheric correction method based on the radiative transfer model.\nif you are doing dynamic monitoring, then you can choose relative atmospheric correction or simpler methods.\nif the parameters are missing, there is no choice but to choose the simpler method.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Data Join Sets/Enhancement\n\n3.1.2.1 Data Join Sets\n\nAn area may need more than one satellite image to be spliced, using mosaic in the R package for the two datasets to be spliced. When selecting images, try to select two images with similar time and date, due to the different date of the image, the image display is different, the reason may be (cloud cover, sunshine), need to use the image increase technique to operate.\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Enhancement\n\n3.1.3.1 Ratio\n\nThe ratio is the difference between two spectral bands with a specific spectral response, using CampTown’s data for NDVI (The Normalised Difference Vegetation Index) The Normalised Difference Vegetation Index is based on the fact that healthy and green vegetation reflects more in the near infrared but absorbs in the red wavelengths. Therefore, the red wavelength band is used for the operation in the formula below. \\[\nNDVI = \\frac{NIR - Red}{NIR + Red}\n\\]\nThe following figure shows the image after manipulation for NDVI (a. After NDVI Formula, b. Extraction only if NDVI is equal to or greater than 0.2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess of Radiometric Calibration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3.2 Texture (Unfinished)\n\nDue to the limitations of R, it takes a long time to run if the map is loaded too large, so only a small part of CampTown was selected for processing. Most of the area can be loaded in Google Earth Engine afterwards. Below is the texture processed study area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess of Radiometric Calibration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3.3 Principal Component Analysis (Unfinished)\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess of Radiometric Calibration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess of Radiometric Calibration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.4 Other Enhancement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnique\nDescription\nApplication\n\n\n\n\nLow Pass Filter\nSmoothes image by averaging pixels.\nReduces noise for better burn area detection.\n\n\nHigh Pass Filter\nEnhances contrast by highlighting local changes.\nImproves distinction between burned/unburned areas.\n\n\nEmbossing\nModifies coefficients to create shadowy edge relief.\nHighlights burn area edges for clearer boundaries.\n\n\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA)\nTransforms multispectral data to smaller, uncorrelated datasets.\nSimplifies data for easier burn area analysis in Landsat images.\n\n\nMulti-date PCA\nCombines different time point bands for PCA.\nIdentifies temporal changes in burn areas across Landsat images.\n\n\nTexture Analysis\nAnalyzes spatial variation in grayscale.\nEnhances burn area detection through texture metrics.\n\n\nImage Fusion\nMerges data from multiple sources/sensors.\nIntegrates different resolutions for more detailed analysis."

    "text": "4.1 Summary of the Policy and City\n\n4.1.1 Dublin City\n\nDublin’s exposure to flood risk is influenced by a number of factors, including urbanisation and climate change(Paranunzio et al. 2022a). This city on the coast has a complex system of rivers, canals, surface water sewers, sewers and urban watercourses, making it particularly sensitive to flooding. Causes of flooding include sea level rise, runoff water, heavy rainfall, extreme events, storms and tidal fluctuations. Flooding events caused by extreme weather have increased significantly over the last decade and this is expected to continue. It is also expected that the number of days of heavy rainfall per year will increase, leading to an increased risk of fluvial (fluvial) and pluvial (pluvial) flooding(Paranunzio et al. 2022b).\nAlso sea level rise in Dublin is an important consideration. As a result of climate change, Dublin City Council has undertaken a review of existing coastal flood defences to ensure they provide protection for the city region. Records show that average sea levels in Dublin Bay have risen faster than the global average between 2000 and 2016(Shoari Nejad et al. 2022).\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Policy Background\n\nThe Dublin City Development Plan (DCDP) 2016-2022 includes a key component, the Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (SFRA). This plan is intended to guide the direction and location of development in Dublin City over the life of the plan(Dublin City Council 2020a). It provides an integrated and coherent spatial framework to ensure that the city develops in an inclusive manner, whilst enhancing the quality of life for its citizens and making Dublin a more attractive place to live and work. This plan was adopted by Dublin City Council at a special meeting on 23rd September 2016 and came into force on 21st October 2016\nThe Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (SFRA) is Volume 7 of the Dublin City Development Plan (DCDP) and is specifically designed to assess and manage flood risk. The purpose of the assessment is to comply with the requirements of the Floods Directive and flood risk/hazard maps are being produced to enable the development of a comprehensive Flood Risk Management Scheme (FRAMS)(Dublin City Council 2020b). The plan also addresses project-specific flood defence infrastructure to protect the more vulnerable parts of the city.\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of Flood Risk Assessment Map( Liffey: Sean Heuston Br. – Sarah Bridge, South Circular Road), Source: Dublin City Council\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of Flood Alleviation Programme ( Liffey: Sean Heuston Br. – Sarah Bridge, South Circular Road), Source: Dublin City Council\n\n\n\n\nRun All Chunks AboveRun Current Chunk Dublin City Council is also working on various projects to address areas of the city that are susceptible to coastal flooding during extreme events and therefore require new protection works. These projects include the South Bank Flood Defence Project, Sandymount Promenade and Flood Defence Project(O’Connell, n.d.), and Clontarf Promenade Development and Flood Defence Project(Cooke et al. 2005). As part of the Sutton to Sandycove promenade and cycle path project(Lyne 2021), the part of the scheme nearer to Bull Island has commenced and includes flood defence work.\n\n\n\n4.1.3 Policy Objective (Unfinished)\n\n提高洪水风险意识：通过洪水风险和危害地图的制作，提高公众、地方当局和其他组织对洪水可能性的认识。\n制定全面的洪水风险管理计划：这些计划旨在应对洪水风险，并根据洪水指令的要求，对可能受洪水影响的区域进行综合评估和管理。\n保护城市脆弱部分：评估中特别列出了一系列洪水防御基础设施，以保护城市中较为脆弱的部分，特别是那些容易受到沿海洪水影响的区域。\n实施防洪工程和改善措施：通过进行各种项目，比如沿海长廊和防洪工程，来应对已知的容易受洪水影响的城市区域。\n对新计划进行洪水风险评估：根据法定的洪水风险管理指南，对新的开发或重建计划进行评估，以确定这些区域的洪水可能性。"

    "text": "4.2 Applications\n\n4.2.1 How should the remotely sense data address the policy objectives\n\n\nFlood Risk Mapping: The use of remote sensing technology in flood prevention can mention its monitoring, provide real-time data, and can provide a guarantee of the timeliness of flood monitoring(Diao, Sang, and Wang 2022).Radar data can be used to focus on the extraction of past flood inundation areas, and to analyse the characteristics of spatial and temporal changes in flooding. At the same time, it can be used to draw high-resolution maps of the impact of river flooding, and use Google Earth Engine to process geospatial data, so as to carry out flood risk management and monitoring of flood disasters(Colacicco et al. 2022).\nImpact Assessment and Recovery Planning: The use of remote sensing data can facilitate post-flood impact assessment and recovery planning. Remote sensing provides clear spatial information for flood inundation mapping, which is critical for timely damage assessment and planning of recovery efforts. By using near real-time (NRT) remote sensing data after a flood event in combination with real-time (RT) volunteer geographic information (VGI), probabilistic flood maps can be generated to identify areas requiring urgent attention(Luo, Liao, and Shen 2023)。In addition, aerial imagery captured by drones can be used to reconstruct 3D models and digital elevation models for flood modelling and damage assessment(Whitehurst et al. 2022). Simulations based on pre- and post-flood digital elevation models can help predict the impact of future rainfall events and guide recovery efforts (Sajjad et al. 2023).\nWatershed management:The use of remote sensing data can improve post-flood impact watershed management. Remote sensing technologies such as satellite imagery can be used to monitor and assess damage caused by floods, including the extent of flooding, infrastructure damage, and changes in land cover and land use (Sridharan, Kumar, and Madhur Kumar 2022). This information helps to assess the effectiveness of watershed development interventions and identify areas for improvement. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) can be integrated with remote sensing data to enhance stakeholder and public participation in the watershed planning process(Quinn et al. 2022). By utilising GIS and remotely sensed datasets, stakeholders can gain valuable information for decision-making and planning(Quinn et al. 2022).\n\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Connect With bigger picture\n\n4.2.2.1 With Local Development\n\nThis policy and its associated Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (SFRA) has had a significant impact on the Local Development Strategy, focussing on sustainable infrastructure and flood risk management. The Plan emphasises the importance of managing surface water drainage and the potential impact of local development on downstream watercourses such as the River Carmichael and the River Liffey. It emphasises the need for additional infrastructure to support development sites, Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SuDS) to effectively manage surface water run-off and improve water quality(Dublin City Council 2020c).\nSuDS infrastructure has been highlighted as a core strategy in the Local Plan, designed to manage surface water sustainably, whilst ensuring that there is no increased risk of flooding either upstream or downstream. The approach includes a variety of SuDS features such as detention ponds, infiltration trenches and depressions designed to reduce runoff and improve water quality. This holistic water management strategy supports the vision of creating a vibrant and sustainable urban area in Dublin(South Dublin City Council, n.d.).\nIn addition, the Plan sets out the need for a comprehensive review of existing and future infrastructure (including sewerage and water supply networks) to accommodate development while managing environmental impacts. This includes considerations for upgrading existing infrastructure (e.g. water mains and sewerage systems) to meet the needs of new development(South Dublin City Council, n.d.).\n\n\n\n4.2.2.2 With Global agenda\n\nIn order to address the identified flood risks, the Plan outlines several strategies and measures. These include the Dublin Coastal Flood Protection Project and participation in the EU Interreg Programme IIIB SAFER project which focuses on coastal flood risk. Dublin City Council works closely with the Office of Public Works (OPW), Ireland’s lead agency for flood risk management, under the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) programme. The programme is at the heart of Ireland’s medium to long term strategy for flood risk reduction and management and involves the production of detailed flood risk maps and management plans for Dublin’s main rivers and coastal areas.(Dublin City Council 2020c)。\nMore broadly the Plan can explicitly link its objectives and strategies to the relevant SDGs, particularly those relating to Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG 11), Climate Action (SDG 13) and Water Resources Management (SDG 6). By integrating the flood risk management strategy with these objectives, Dublin can demonstrate its commitment to the global sustainable development agenda while addressing local challenges(Anthony F and Max, n.d.)。\nSchemes should ensure compliance with EU Directives relevant to flood risk management, such as the EU Floods Directive, which requires Member States to assess and manage flood risk in order to reduce the impact of flooding on human health, the environment, cultural heritage and economic activities. By aligning the SFRA with these directives, Dublin City Council can integrate European standards into local practice, facilitate cross-border co-operation and share best practice(herve 2021)。\n\n\n\n\n4.2.3 Types of Remotely Sense Data can be use for the Flooding analysis\n爱尔兰公共工程办公室（Office of Public Works, OPW）提供了全国指示性河流地图（National Indicative Fluvial Mapping），这是洪水风险管理的关键工具。这些地图提供了关于洪水范围、危险和风险的详细信息，包括频繁、轻微的洪水事件到非常罕见、极端事件的评估和映射。\n\n\n4.2.4 Reflect (Unfinished)\n::: {style=“text-align: justify;”} Incorporating the application of remote sensing technologies into the context of the Dublin City Development Plan 2016-2022 and its Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (SFRA) not only broadens the scope of my reflection but also enhances the depth of analysis on how technological advancements can be synergized with urban planning and environmental management practices. This expanded consideration allows for a multifaceted approach towards sustainable urban development, emphasizing the critical role of innovative technologies in addressing complex urban challenges.\nRemote sensing, with its capacity to collect detailed environmental data from a distance, presents an invaluable tool for urban planners and policymakers. By facilitating a comprehensive analysis of land use changes, vegetation cover, water bodies, and urban infrastructure, remote sensing data can significantly contribute to informed decision-making processes. For Dublin, leveraging such technologies means the ability to dynamically monitor urban expansion and its impacts on flood risks, assess vulnerabilities across the urban landscape, and develop targeted strategies for flood mitigation and urban resilience.\nThis integration goes beyond traditional planning methods by enabling a proactive rather than reactive approach to urban development and environmental stewardship. The precision and timeliness of data provided by remote sensing can lead to the early identification of potential flood-prone areas, changes in land cover that may affect hydrological cycles, and the effectiveness of existing flood defense structures. Consequently, this facilitates the optimization of land use planning, infrastructure development, and environmental conservation efforts to mitigate flood risks effectively.\nFurthermore, the application of remote sensing technologies underscores the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and capacity building among urban planners, environmental scientists, and the broader community. Engaging with a diverse range of stakeholders in the interpretation and application of remote sensing data can foster a more inclusive and participatory approach to urban planning. This collaborative framework not only enhances the understanding and management of flood risks but also promotes a shared sense of responsibility and collective action towards sustainable urban development.\nMoreover, the ongoing advancement in remote sensing technologies, including higher resolution imagery, real-time data acquisition, and improved analytical tools, offers new opportunities for innovation in urban planning and environmental management. As cities like Dublin strive to align their development strategies with global sustainability goals, the integration of such technologies becomes increasingly crucial. It allows for a more nuanced understanding of urban ecosystems, the interconnections between human activities and natural processes, and the pathways towards achieving a harmonious balance between urban development and environmental preservation.\nIn summary, the reflection on integrating remote sensing technologies into Dublin’s urban planning and flood risk management efforts highlights the transformative potential of such tools in advancing sustainable urban development. It points towards a future where technology and data-driven insights become central to crafting resilient, inclusive, and sustainable urban landscapes. This expanded perspective not only enriches my understanding of the complexities involved in urban planning but also inspires a forward-looking approach to leveraging technology for the betterment of our urban environments.\n\n\n\n\nAnthony F, Pipa, and Bouchet Max. n.d. “Local Leadership Driving Progress on the Sustainable Development Goals.” https://www.brookings.edu/articles/local-leadership-driving-progress-on-the-sustainable-development-goals/.\n\n\nColacicco, Rosa, Alberto Refice, Raffaele Nutricato, Annarita D’Addabbo, Davide Oscar Nitti, and Domenico Capolongo. 2022. “High Spatial and Temporal Resolution Flood Monitoring Through Integration of Multisensor Remotely Sensed Data and Google Earth Engine Processing.” https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu22-4403.\n\n\nCooke, I, A D Maguire, O McManus, and B Bliek. 2005. “The Dublin Coastal Protection Project.” WIT Transactions on The Built Environment 78.\n\n\nDiao, Chao, Guoqing Sang, and JunNuo Wang. 2022. “Research on the Application of Remote Sensing Monitoring to Flood Monitoring Based on Sentinel-1A in Linyi City.” 2022 3rd International Conference on Geology, Mapping and Remote Sensing (ICGMRS), April. https://doi.org/10.1109/icgmrs55602.2022.9849305.\n\n\nDublin City Council. 2020c. “3.5.3 Climate Change and Flood Risk | Dublin City Council.” https://www.dublincity.ie/dublin-city-development-plan-2016-2022/3-addressing-climate-change/35-policies-and-objectives/353-climate-change-and-flood-risk.\n\n\n———. 2020a. “3.5.3 Climate Change and Flood Risk | Dublin City Council.” https://www.dublincity.ie/dublin-city-development-plan-2016-2022/3-addressing-climate-change/35-policies-and-objectives/353-climate-change-and-flood-risk.\n\n\n———. 2020b. “3.5.3 Climate Change and Flood Risk | Dublin City Council.” https://www.dublincity.ie/dublin-city-development-plan-2016-2022/3-addressing-climate-change/35-policies-and-objectives/353-climate-change-and-flood-risk.\n\n\nherve. 2021. “Global Policies in Local Context: Local Transformation Through International Engagement - Platforma.” https://platforma-dev.eu/global-policies-in-local-context-local-transformation-through-international-engagement/, https://platforma-dev.eu/global-policies-in-local-context-local-transformation-through-international-engagement/.\n\n\nLuo, Huanzhang, Jingjuan Liao, and Guozhuang Shen. 2023. “Combining Remote Sensing and Social Media Data for Flood Mapping: A Case Study in Linhai, Zhejiang Province, China.” Journal of Applied Remote Sensing 17 (2): 024507. https://doi.org/10.1117/1.JRS.17.024507.\n\n\nLyne, Laura. 2021. “Dublin Residents Fearing Worst as Dream Cycleway at Risk Due to Plan Changes.” https://www.dublinlive.ie/news/dublin-news/residents-fear-dream-sutton-sandycove-20368777.\n\n\nO’Connell, Gerard. n.d. “Sandymount Coastal Flood Defence SchemePhase 1&2.”\n\n\nParanunzio, Roberta, Marco Guerrini, Edward Dwyer, Paul J.
