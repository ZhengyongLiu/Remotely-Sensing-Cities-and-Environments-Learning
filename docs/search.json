    "text": "1.1 Knowledge gain From the Lecture\n\nThis week’s learning journey into the realm of remote sensing, unveiling the intricate world of electromagnetic waves and their interactions with Earth’s surface. Remote sensing, as I’ve learned, involves acquiring information about objects or areas from a distance, typically from aircraft or satellites, and is a vital tool in understanding our planet.\n\n\n1.1.1 Foundational Concepts of Remote Sensing\n\nOne of the foundational concepts we explored was the difference between passive and active remote sensing. Passive remote sensing relies on natural energy, usually from the sun, whereas active remote sensing systems emit their own energy to illuminate objects. This distinction is crucial for understanding the varied applications of remote sensing technologies like LiDAR, radar, and satellite imagery in observing earth’s landscapes, urban areas, and atmospheric conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\nPassive & Active Remote Sensing, Source: Abeer Nazar Abdul-Hameed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.2 Electromagnetic Waves: Core of Remote Sensing\n\nMuch of our learning knowledge focused on electromagnetic waves, the heart of remote sensing. These waves, a form of energy that propagates through electric and magnetic fields, are the backbone of how remote sensors collect data. Remote sensing is based on this principle to detect the reflection of electromagnetic waves by surface objects and their emission of electromagnetic waves, so as to extract information about these objects and complete the identification of objects at a distance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Electromagnetic Spectrum, Source: Cssonawala\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.3 Interactions with Earth’s Surface\n\nWe have looked at the complexities of how electromagnetic radiation (EMR) interacts with the Earth’s surface. This interaction is not straightforward because EMR can be absorbed, transmitted or scattered by the surface and atmosphere. Scattering, in particular, explains phenomena such as the blue colour of the sky or the blackness of the lunar sky due to the absence of an atmosphere. This concept has far-reaching implications for environmental monitoring and the study of planetary bodies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteraction of EMR with Earth’s Surface, Source: Geographicbook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.4 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and its Applications\n\nThe Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) was another fascinating topic. SAR’s ability to ‘see through clouds’ using longer wavelengths is revolutionary, offering a consistent observation capability irrespective of weather conditions. This technology’s potential in areas like topography, vegetation analysis, and urban planning is immense, showcasing how advanced remote sensing techniques can overcome environmental challenges\nThe study of SAR data also introduced us to the concept of polarization, a property of electromagnetic waves that describes their oscillation direction. This property is crucial for understanding how radar signals interact with different surface properties and is instrumental in enhancing the efficiency and bandwidth of communications.\n\n\n\n1.1.5 Technical Insights and Data Formats in Remote Sensing\n\nOn the technical side, we learned about the different data formats used in remote sensing, such as GeoTIFF, and the importance of resolutions - spatial, spectral, temporal and radiometric. These resolutions define the quality and type of data acquired, and influence how effectively we can interpret and use the data for various applications such as land cover mapping and environmental monitoring.\nIn the literature, these concepts are used to analyse environmental change, urban development and geological features. Understanding remote sensing data and their interpretation is essential for researchers and policy makers to make informed decisions."

    "text": "1.3 Reflecting From the Lecture\n\nReflecting on the week’s learning, I am struck by the profound impact that remote sensing has on our understanding of the world. The ability to observe and analyse our planet from a distance provides a unique perspective that is not possible through ground-based observations alone. It literally allows us to see the bigger picture, providing a comprehensive understanding of large-scale environmental patterns, urban development and even climate change.\nRemote sensing is interdisciplinary in nature. It’s not just a tool for geographers or environmental scientists; it integrates physics, engineering, environmental science and even policy-making. This integration demonstrates the collaborative effort required to address complex global issues. For example, remote sensing data can inform policies on urban planning, agricultural practices and disaster management, making it a critical tool for sustainable development.\nAnother aspect is the rapid evolution of remote sensing technology. With innovations such as high-resolution imagery and real-time data analysis, the potential applications of this technology are expanding at an incredible rate."

    "text": "3.1 Knowledge gain From the Lecture\n\nThis week’s study focuses on remote sensing image processing, with the main areas of interest being geometric corrections, atmospheric corrections, orthometric corrections, radiometric corrections and various image enhancement techniques.\n\n\n3.1.1 Correction\n\n3.1.1.1 Geometric Correction\n\nGeometric correction is the basis of image correction and addresses image distortion due to sensor and other factors. The goal of this correction is to make the image conform to the selected map projection system, adjusting the geometry of the entire image by modelling the relationship between control points (points with known geographic coordinates) on the image and the image coordinates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Geometric Correction Work, Source: Xiaopeng\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the above calibration process, it can be done by the following equation For a point ((x, y)) in the distorted image, the corresponding point ((x’, y’)) in the geometrically corrected image can be calculated using:\n\\[\nx' = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 y + a_3 x^2 + a_4 xy + a_5 y^2 + \\ldots\n\\] \\[\ny' = b_0 + b_1 x + b_2 y + b_3 x^2 + b_4 xy + b_5 y^2 + \\ldots\n\\]\nHere, (a_0, a_1, , a_n) and (b_0, b_1, , b_n) are coefficients determined through a calibration process using ground control points (GCPs), which are points whose true position is known. The number of terms in the polynomial (and thus the number of coefficients) depends on the degree of the polynomial required to model the distortion adequately. A first-degree polynomial correction (affine transformation) would not include the squared terms, for example.\n\n\n\n3.1.1.2 Atmospheric Correction\n\nAtmospheric corrections are essential to address distortions and inaccuracies in remotely sensed images caused by variations in the Earth’s atmosphere, sensor angles, and terrain. Several different correction methods were learned in class: Relative Atmospheric Correction, Pseudo-Invariant Correction, Absolute Atmospheric Correction, and Empirical Line Correction.\n\nThe different methods and characteristics of atmospheric correction have been summarised in the table below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod\nKey Steps\nFeature\n\n\n\n\nRelative\nSpectrally stable landmarks, linear relations, band operation\nConsistency between images\n\n\nAbsolute\nComplex models for atmospheric effects, surface reflectance\nPrecise, accurate surface information\n\n\nPseudo-Invariant\nHigh-quality reference, PIF, linear regression\nStable reference points, reduce atmospheric effects\n\n\nEmpirical Line\nGround reflectance, average DN values, linear regression\nUtilizes ground data for satellite correction\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.1.3 Radiometric Correction\n\nThe role of radiometric correction in adjusting the pixel values of satellite imagery to accurately reflect the radiation at the Earth’s surface has been investigated. The main objective of radiometric correction is to convert the raw digital numbers (DN) acquired into physically meaningful units such as radiance or reflectance. This conversion is critical because DN values are arbitrary and can vary between sensors, acquisitions and platforms, making it difficult to consistently compare and analyse data. By converting DN values to radiance or reflectance, radiometric correction enables quantitative measurements and meaningful comparisons between different images and sensors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess of Radiometric Calibration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.1.4 Reflection of Collerallation\n\nIn the course of study, certain questions arise as to when atmospheric corrections are needed and whether or not the images we buy or otherwise acquire have been atmospherically corrected. In layman’s terms, if we need to use an image that truly reflects the Sun’s radiation for quantitative inversion or to obtain information about the Earth, accurately identify features, etc., then we need to make an atmospheric correction. When we buy an image, the description document says that it is radiometrically corrected. In fact, this radiometric correction refers to the coarse radiometric correction, which is just a systematic atmospheric correction, which has the same meaning as the systematic geometric correction.\nAt the moment there are many models and methods on the market, since there are how many methods, then there is the problem of method selection. Here is a summary for reference:\n\nif it is a fine quantitative study, then choose the atmospheric correction method based on the radiative transfer model.\nif you are doing dynamic monitoring, then you can choose relative atmospheric correction or simpler methods.\nif the parameters are missing, there is no choice but to choose the simpler method.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Data Join Sets/Enhancement\n\n3.1.2.1 Data Join Sets\n\nAn area may need more than one satellite image to be spliced, using mosaic in the R package for the two datasets to be spliced. When selecting images, try to select two images with similar time and date, due to the different date of the image, the image display is different, the reason may be (cloud cover, sunshine), need to use the image increase technique to operate.\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Enhancement\n\n3.1.3.1 Ratio\n\nThe ratio is the difference between two spectral bands with a specific spectral response, using CampTown’s data for NDVI (The Normalised Difference Vegetation Index) The Normalised Difference Vegetation Index is based on the fact that healthy and green vegetation reflects more in the near infrared but absorbs in the red wavelengths. Therefore, the red wavelength band is used for the operation in the formula below. \\[\nNDVI = \\frac{NIR - Red}{NIR + Red}\n\\]\nThe following figure shows the image after manipulation for NDVI (a. After NDVI Formula, b. Extraction only if NDVI is equal to or greater than 0.2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess of Radiometric Calibration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3.2 Texture (Unfinished)\n\nDue to the limitations of R, it takes a long time to run if the map is loaded too large, so only a small part of CampTown was selected for processing. Most of the area can be loaded in Google Earth Engine afterwards. Below is the texture processed study area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess of Radiometric Calibration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3.3 Principal Component Analysis (Unfinished)\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess of Radiometric Calibration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess of Radiometric Calibration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.4 Other Enhancement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnique\nDescription\nApplication\n\n\n\n\nLow Pass Filter\nSmoothes image by averaging pixels.\nReduces noise for better burn area detection.\n\n\nHigh Pass Filter\nEnhances contrast by highlighting local changes.\nImproves distinction between burned/unburned areas.\n\n\nEmbossing\nModifies coefficients to create shadowy edge relief.\nHighlights burn area edges for clearer boundaries.\n\n\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA)\nTransforms multispectral data to smaller, uncorrelated datasets.\nSimplifies data for easier burn area analysis in Landsat images.\n\n\nMulti-date PCA\nCombines different time point bands for PCA.\nIdentifies temporal changes in burn areas across Landsat images.\n\n\nTexture Analysis\nAnalyzes spatial variation in grayscale.\nEnhances burn area detection through texture metrics.\n\n\nImage Fusion\nMerges data from multiple sources/sensors.\nIntegrates different resolutions for more detailed analysis."
