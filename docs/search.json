    "text": "1.1 Knowledge gain From the Lecture\n\nThis week’s learning journey into the realm of remote sensing, unveiling the intricate world of electromagnetic waves and their interactions with Earth’s surface. Remote sensing, as I’ve learned, involves acquiring information about objects or areas from a distance, typically from aircraft or satellites, and is a vital tool in understanding our planet.\n\n\n1.1.1 Foundational Concepts of Remote Sensing\n\nOne of the foundational concepts we explored was the difference between passive and active remote sensing. Passive remote sensing relies on natural energy, usually from the sun, whereas active remote sensing systems emit their own energy to illuminate objects. This distinction is crucial for understanding the varied applications of remote sensing technologies like LiDAR, radar, and satellite imagery in observing earth’s landscapes, urban areas, and atmospheric conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\nPassive & Active Remote Sensing, Source: Abeer Nazar Abdul-Hameed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.2 Electromagnetic Waves: Core of Remote Sensing\n\nMuch of our learning knowledge focused on electromagnetic waves, the heart of remote sensing. These waves, a form of energy that propagates through electric and magnetic fields, are the backbone of how remote sensors collect data. Remote sensing is based on this principle to detect the reflection of electromagnetic waves by surface objects and their emission of electromagnetic waves, so as to extract information about these objects and complete the identification of objects at a distance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Electromagnetic Spectrum, Source: Cssonawala\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.3 Interactions with Earth’s Surface\n\nWe have looked at the complexities of how electromagnetic radiation (EMR) interacts with the Earth’s surface. EMR can be absorbed, transmitted or scattered by the surface and atmosphere. Scattering, in particular, explains phenomena such as the blue colour of the sky or the blackness of the lunar sky due to the absence of an atmosphere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteraction of EMR with Earth’s Surface, Source: Geographicbook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.4 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and its Applications\n\nThe Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) was another fascinating topic. SAR’s ability to ‘see through clouds’ using longer wavelengths is revolutionary, offering a consistent observation capability irrespective of weather conditions. This technology’s potential in areas like topography, vegetation analysis, and urban planning is immense, showcasing how advanced remote sensing techniques can overcome environmental challenges\nThe study of SAR data also introduced us to the concept of polarization, a property of electromagnetic waves that describes their oscillation direction. This property is crucial for understanding how radar signals interact with different surface properties and is instrumental in enhancing the efficiency and bandwidth of communications.\n\n\n\n1.1.5 Technical Insights and Data Formats in Remote Sensing\n\nOn the technical side, we learned about the different data formats used in remote sensing, such as GeoTIFF, and the importance of resolutions - spatial, spectral, temporal and radiometric. These resolutions define the quality and type of data acquired, and influence how effectively we can interpret and use the data for various applications such as land cover mapping and environmental monitoring.\nIn the literature, these concepts are used to analyse environmental change, urban development and geological features. Understanding remote sensing data and their interpretation is essential for researchers and policy makers to make informed decisions."

    "text": "1.2 Reflecting From the Lecture\n\nReflecting on the week’s learning, I am struck by the profound impact that remote sensing has on our understanding of the world. The ability to observe and analyse our planet from a distance provides a unique perspective that is not possible through ground-based observations alone. It literally allows us to see the bigger picture, providing a comprehensive understanding of large-scale environmental patterns, urban development and even climate change.\nRemote sensing is interdisciplinary in nature. It’s not just a tool for geographers or environmental scientists; it integrates physics, engineering, environmental science and even policy-making. This integration demonstrates the collaborative effort required to address complex global issues. For example, remote sensing data can inform policies on urban planning, agricultural practices and disaster management, making it a critical tool for sustainable development.\nAnother aspect is the rapid evolution of remote sensing technology. With innovations such as high-resolution imagery and real-time data analysis, the potential applications of this technology are expanding at an incredible rate."

    "section": "3.1 Knowledge gain From the Lecture",
    "text": "3.1 Knowledge gain From the Lecture\n\nThis week’s study focuses on remote sensing image processing, with the main areas of interest being geometric corrections, atmospheric corrections, orthometric corrections, radiometric corrections and various image enhancement techniques.\n\n\n3.1.1 Correction\n\n3.1.1.1 Geometric Correction\n\nGeometric correction is the basis of image correction and addresses image distortion due to sensor and other factors. The goal of this correction is to make the image conform to the selected map projection system, adjusting the geometry of the entire image by modelling the relationship between control points (points with known geographic coordinates) on the image and the image coordinates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Geometric Correction Work, Source: Xiaopeng\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.1.2 Atmospheric Correction\n\nAtmospheric corrections are essential to address distortions and inaccuracies in remotely sensed images caused by variations in the Earth’s atmosphere, sensor angles, and terrain. Several different correction methods were learned in class: Relative Atmospheric Correction, Pseudo-Invariant Correction, Absolute Atmospheric Correction, and Empirical Line Correction.\n\nThe different methods and characteristics of atmospheric correction have been summarised in the table below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod\nKey Steps\nFeature\n\n\n\n\nRelative\nSpectrally stable landmarks, linear relations, band operation\nConsistency between images\n\n\nAbsolute\nComplex models for atmospheric effects, surface reflectance\nPrecise, accurate surface information\n\n\nPseudo-Invariant\nHigh-quality reference, PIF, linear regression\nStable reference points, reduce atmospheric effects\n\n\nEmpirical Line\nGround reflectance, average DN values, linear regression\nUtilizes ground data for satellite correction\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.1.3 Radiometric Correction\n\nThe role of radiometric correction in adjusting the pixel values of satellite imagery to accurately reflect the radiation at the Earth’s surface has been investigated. The main objective of radiometric correction is to convert the raw digital numbers (DN) acquired into physically meaningful units such as radiance or reflectance. This conversion is critical because DN values are arbitrary and can vary between sensors, acquisitions and platforms, making it difficult to consistently compare and analyse data. By converting DN values to radiance or reflectance, radiometric correction enables quantitative measurements and meaningful comparisons between different images and sensors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess of Radiometric Calibration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.1.4 Reflection of Collerallation\n\nIn the course of study, certain questions arise as to when atmospheric corrections are needed and whether or not the images we buy or otherwise acquire have been atmospherically corrected. In layman’s terms, if we need to use an image that truly reflects the Sun’s radiation for quantitative inversion or to obtain information about the Earth, accurately identify features, etc., then we need to make an atmospheric correction. When we buy an image, the description document says that it is radiometrically corrected. In fact, this radiometric correction refers to the coarse radiometric correction, which is just a systematic atmospheric correction, which has the same meaning as the systematic geometric correction.\nAt the moment there are many models and methods on the market, since there are how many methods, then there is the problem of method selection. Here is a summary for reference:\n\nif it is a fine quantitative study, then choose the atmospheric correction method based on the radiative transfer model.\nif you are doing dynamic monitoring, then you can choose relative atmospheric correction or simpler methods.\nif the parameters are missing, there is no choice but to choose the simpler method.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Data Join Sets/Enhancement\n\n3.1.2.1 Data Join Sets\n\nAn area may need more than one satellite image to be spliced, using mosaic in the R package for the two datasets to be spliced. When selecting images, try to select two images with similar time and date, due to the different date of the image, the image display is different, the reason may be (cloud cover, sunshine), need to use the image increase technique to operate.\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Enhancement\n\n3.1.3.1 Ratio\n\nThe ratio is the difference between two spectral bands with a specific spectral response, using CampTown’s data for NDVI (The Normalised Difference Vegetation Index) The Normalised Difference Vegetation Index is based on the fact that healthy and green vegetation reflects more in the near infrared but absorbs in the red wavelengths. Therefore, the red wavelength band is used for the operation in the formula below.\n\\[\nNDVI = \\frac{NIR - Red}{NIR + Red}\n\\]\nThe following figure shows the image after manipulation for NDVI (a. After NDVI Formula, b. Extraction only if NDVI is equal to or greater than 0.2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess of Radiometric Calibration\n\n\n\n\nThis case above can be applied to other index calculations such as NDWI (Normalised Difference Water Index) and NDDI (Normalised Difference Drought Index). These are calculated using the reflectance of different objects in different light waves.\n\n\n3.1.3.2 Texture\n\nThe extraction method of texture features is relatively simple, it is to use an active window to slide continuously on the image, calculate the variance, mean, maximum, minimum and the difference between the two and the information entropy in the window, etc., respectively, to form the corresponding texture image, when the spectral characteristics of the target are relatively close to each other, the texture features can play a positive role in distinguishing the target. When the spectral characteristics of the target are close, the texture features can play a positive role in distinguishing the target. After selecting the appropriate dynamic range of the data and extracting the texture features, the texture features of the image can be highlighted, which is conducive to the extraction of constructive information. Below is an example of a texture treatment for the Cape Town area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter of Texture Process"

    "text": "3.2 Application in Literature\n\nImage correction is a critical step in remote sensing to ensure the accuracy and usability of data obtained from satellite or aerial imagery. Radiometric correction involves adjusting digital image data to correct for sensor noise, sensor response variations and atmospheric conditions. Various methods have been proposed for radiometric correction of remote sensing images. Duan(2014) proposed a radiation correction method that replaces artificial targets with standard ground objects, resulting in accurate and precise correction. Tarasenkov(2019) developed a program complex for atmospheric correction of satellite images that considers radiation polarization.\nGeometric correction corrects the image so that the proportions are uniform throughout the image. This correction is essential for accurate mapping and measurement tasks. Geometric correction is useful for removing spatial distortion, aligning images of the same sample, and stitching overlapping images together.(Yan et al. 2023). Various methods and devices have been developed for geometric correction, including those based on orthographic images and homonymous point matching. These techniques improve the accuracy and stability of the geometric information in the corrected image(Özciḣan et al. 2023).\nAtmospheric correction is necessary for various remote sensing applications to improve the accuracy and reliability of derived information. Different algorithms, such as 6S, FLAASH, DOS, LaSRC, and Sen2Cor, have been evaluated for their performance in atmospheric correction(Muchsin et al. 2023). Atmospheric corrections are essential for a variety of applications such as aircraft navigation, astronomical observations and accurate estimation of cloud heights(Shah, Raval, and Divakaran 2022). It ensures that satellite images provide reliable and accurate results by taking into account atmospheric disturbance(Jonah and Aketi, n.d.).\nImage enhancement technology aims to improve the quality and visual effect of remote sensing images. Various methods have been proposed to enhance these images, including histogram modification, transform domain methods, and hybrid approaches. Histogram modification methods focus on modifying the histogram of the input image to achieve a more uniform distribution, resulting in better contrast improvement. Transform domain methods apply specific transforms to enhance the image in the transform domain, leading to better edge enhancement and color preservation(Wang et al. 2023). Hybrid methods, which combine histogram modification and transform domain methods, have shown higher potential in enhancing remote sensing images(Deng et al. 2023). These enhancement techniques are crucial for image interpretation, improving image segmentation accuracy, and facilitating downstream tasks."

    "text": "4.1 Summary of the Policy and City\n\n4.1.1 Dublin City\n\nDublin’s exposure to flood risk is influenced by a number of factors, including urbanisation and climate change(Paranunzio et al. 2022a). This city on the coast has a complex system of rivers, canals, surface water sewers, sewers and urban watercourses, making it particularly sensitive to flooding. Causes of flooding include sea level rise, runoff water, heavy rainfall, extreme events, storms and tidal fluctuations. Flooding events caused by extreme weather have increased significantly over the last decade and this is expected to continue. It is also expected that the number of days of heavy rainfall per year will increase, leading to an increased risk of fluvial (fluvial) and pluvial (pluvial) flooding(Paranunzio et al. 2022b).\nAlso sea level rise in Dublin is an important consideration. As a result of climate change, Dublin City Council has undertaken a review of existing coastal flood defences to ensure they provide protection for the city region. Records show that average sea levels in Dublin Bay have risen faster than the global average between 2000 and 2016(Shoari Nejad et al. 2022).\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Policy Background\n\nThe Dublin City Development Plan (DCDP) 2016-2022 includes a key component, the Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (SFRA). This plan is intended to guide the direction and location of development in Dublin City over the life of the plan(Dublin City Council 2020a). It provides an integrated and coherent spatial framework to ensure that the city develops in an inclusive manner, whilst enhancing the quality of life for its citizens and making Dublin a more attractive place to live and work. This plan was adopted by Dublin City Council at a special meeting on 23rd September 2016 and came into force on 21st October 2016\nThe Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (SFRA) is Volume 7 of the Dublin City Development Plan (DCDP) and is specifically designed to assess and manage flood risk. The purpose of the assessment is to comply with the requirements of the Floods Directive and flood risk/hazard maps are being produced to enable the development of a comprehensive Flood Risk Management Scheme (FRAMS)(Dublin City Council 2020b). The plan also addresses project-specific flood defense infrastructure to protect the more vulnerable parts of the city.\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of Flood Risk Assessment Map( Liffey: Sean Heuston Br. – Sarah Bridge, South Circular Road), Source: Dublin City Council\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of Flood Alleviation Programme ( Liffey: Sean Heuston Br. – Sarah Bridge, South Circular Road), Source: Dublin City Council\n\n\n\n\nDublin City Council is also working on various projects to address areas of the city that are susceptible to coastal flooding during extreme events and therefore require new protection works. These projects include the South Bank Flood Defence Project, Sandymount Promenade and Flood Defence Project(O’Connell, n.d.), and Clontarf Promenade Development and Flood Defence Project(Cooke et al. 2005). As part of the Sutton to Sandycove promenade and cycle path project(Lyne 2021), the part of the scheme nearer to Bull Island has commenced and includes flood defence work.\n\n\n\n4.1.3 Policy & Objectives\n\n\nClimate Change Mitigation and Adaptation: Implementing strategies to address climate change impacts on flooding.\nStrategic Flood Risk Assessment: Conducting assessments to inform and improve the city’s flood defenses.\nSustainable Environmental Infrastructure: Mitigating flood and drought effects through environmental assessments and planning.\nDevelopment Compliance: Ensuring new developments respect and enhance existing flood defense mechanisms.\nSustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDS): Mandating SUDS in new developments for better water management.\nSite-Specific Flood Risk Assessments: Requiring detailed flood risk analyses for all new development proposals.\nCollaborative Flood Management: Working with neighboring authorities and incorporating catchment-based flood risk management plans.\nGreen Infrastructure Integration: Utilizing green spaces for flood management, biodiversity, and recreation, in line with SUDS principles."

    "text": "4.2 Applications\n\n4.2.1 How Remote Sensing Data Should Address Policy Objectives\n\n\nFlood Risk Mapping: The use of remote sensing technology in flood prevention can mention its monitoring, provide real-time data, and can provide a guarantee of the timeliness of flood monitoring(Diao, Sang, and Wang 2022).Radar data can be used to focus on the extraction of past flood inundation areas, and to analyse the characteristics of spatial and temporal changes in flooding. At the same time, it can be used to draw high-resolution maps of the impact of river flooding, and use Google Earth Engine to process geospatial data, so as to carry out flood risk management and monitoring of flood disasters(Colacicco et al. 2022).\nImpact Assessment and Recovery Planning: The use of remote sensing data can facilitate post-flood impact assessment and recovery planning. Remote sensing provides clear spatial information for flood inundation mapping, which is critical for timely damage assessment and planning of recovery efforts. By using near real-time (NRT) remote sensing data after a flood event in combination with real-time (RT) volunteer geographic information (VGI), probabilistic flood maps can be generated to identify areas requiring urgent attention(Luo, Liao, and Shen 2023)。In addition, aerial imagery captured by drones can be used to reconstruct 3D models and digital elevation models for flood modelling and damage assessment(Whitehurst et al. 2022). Simulations based on pre- and post-flood digital elevation models can help predict the impact of future rainfall events and guide recovery efforts (Sajjad et al. 2023).\nWatershed management:The use of remote sensing data can improve post-flood impact watershed management. Remote sensing technologies such as satellite imagery can be used to monitor and assess damage caused by floods, including the extent of flooding, infrastructure damage, and changes in land cover and land use (Sridharan, Kumar, and Madhur Kumar 2022). This information helps to assess the effectiveness of watershed development interventions and identify areas for improvement. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) can be integrated with remote sensing data to enhance stakeholder and public participation in the watershed planning process(Quinn et al. 2022). By utilising GIS and remotely sensed datasets, stakeholders can gain valuable information for decision-making and planning(Quinn et al. 2022).\n\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Connecting to the Big Picture\n\n4.2.2.1 With Local Development\n\nThis policy and its associated Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (SFRA) has had a significant impact on the Local Development Strategy, focussing on sustainable infrastructure and flood risk management. The Plan emphasises the importance of managing surface water drainage and the potential impact of local development on downstream watercourses such as the River Carmichael and the River Liffey. It emphasises the need for additional infrastructure to support development sites, Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SuDS) to effectively manage surface water run-off and improve water quality(Dublin City Council 2020c).\nSuDS infrastructure has been highlighted as a core strategy in the Local Plan, designed to manage surface water sustainably, whilst ensuring that there is no increased risk of flooding either upstream or downstream. The approach includes a variety of SuDS features such as detention ponds, infiltration trenches and depressions designed to reduce runoff and improve water quality. This holistic water management strategy supports the vision of creating a vibrant and sustainable urban area in Dublin(South Dublin City Council, n.d.).\nIn addition, the Plan sets out the need for a comprehensive review of existing and future infrastructure (including sewerage and water supply networks) to accommodate development while managing environmental impacts. This includes considerations for upgrading existing infrastructure (e.g. water mains and sewerage systems) to meet the needs of new development(South Dublin City Council, n.d.).\n\n\n\n\n\nDublin Flooding Protection Location, Author: I.Cooke\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2.2.2 With Global Agenda\n\nIn order to address the identified flood risks, the Plan outlines several strategies and measures. These include the Dublin Coastal Flood Protection Project and participation in the EU Interreg Programme IIIB SAFER project which focuses on coastal flood risk. Dublin City Council works closely with the Office of Public Works (OPW), Ireland’s lead agency for flood risk management, under the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) programme. The programme is at the heart of Ireland’s medium to long term strategy for flood risk reduction and management and involves the production of detailed flood risk maps and management plans for Dublin’s main rivers and coastal areas.(Dublin City Council 2020c)。\nMore broadly the Plan can explicitly link its objectives and strategies to the relevant SDGs, particularly those relating to Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG 11), Climate Action (SDG 13) and Water Resources Management (SDG 6). By integrating the flood risk management strategy with these objectives, Dublin can demonstrate its commitment to the global sustainable development agenda while addressing local challenges(Anthony F and Max, n.d.)。\nSchemes should ensure compliance with EU Directives relevant to flood risk management, such as the EU Floods Directive, which requires Member States to assess and manage flood risk in order to reduce the impact of flooding on human health, the environment, cultural heritage and economic activities. By aligning the SFRA with these directives, Dublin City Council can integrate European standards into local practice, facilitate cross-border co-operation and share best practice(herve 2021)。\n\n\n\n\n4.2.3 Types of Remotely Sense Data Can be use for the Urban Flooding Analysis\n\n4.2.3.1 General Data\n\nThe following table presents general data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSatellites\nSensors\nSpectral Measurements\nParameter\n\n\n\n\nLandsat 5, 7, 8\nETM+, OLI\nVisible, Near IR, Middle IR,\nReflectance/True Color Image,\n\n\n\n\nThermal IR\nLand Cover, Surface Inundation\n\n\nTRMM & GPM\nMicrowave\nTMI: 10-85 Ghz; GMI: 10-183 GHZ;\nPrecipitation\n\n\n\nRadiometer and\nPR and DPR (Ku and Ka)\n\n\n\n\nRADAR (TMI, PR,\n\n\n\n\n\nGMI, DPR)\n\n\n\n\nTerra & Aqua\nMODIS\nVisible, Near IR, Middle IR\nReflectance/True Color Image,\n\n\n\n\n\nSurface Inundation, Land Cover\n\n\nSNPP\nVIIRS\nVisible, Near IR, Middle IR\nDay/Night Imagery\n\n\nSMAP\nMicrowave\n1.41 GHz\nSoil Moisture\n\n\n\nRadiometer\n\n\n\n\nSentinel 1A and 1B\nSynthetic\nC-Band\nBackscatter/Surface Inundation\n\n\n\nAperture RADAR\n\n\n\n\n\n(SAR)\n\n\n\n\nSpace Shuttle\nSRTM\nC-Band\nTerrain\n\n\n\n\n4.2.3.2 Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Mission\nThe Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission plays a crucial role in analyzing global rainfall patterns. It stands at the forefront of flooding trend analysis, thanks to its comprehensive and derived algorithms. Recognized for its unparalleled popularity and reliability, GPM serves as the primary source of data and analysis method for studying precipitation(Skofronick-Jackson et al. 2018).\nGPM represents an international collaboration, involving a network of satellites dedicated to providing advanced observations of rain and snow across the globe. It builds on the achievements of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and introduces the concept of a Core Observatory. This central satellite is equipped with sophisticated radar and radiometer systems designed to accurately measure precipitation from space. This Core Observatory also plays a pivotal role in standardizing precipitation measurements collected from a constellation of both research and operational satellites, ensuring consistent and reliable data worldwide(Hou 2012).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Mission, Source: NASA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2.3.3 Relative Data Source Link\n\nGPM IMERG Data Access: https://gpm.nasa.gov/data\nPrecipitation Data Access and Analysis: https://giovanni.gsfc.nasa.gov/giovanni/\nMODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS): https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/ or https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/\nVisible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS): https://worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov/\nSoil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP): https://nsidc.org/data/search#keywords=soil+moisture/\nETC……"

    "text": "4.3 Reflect (Unfinished)\n\nIncorporating the application of remote sensing technologies into the context of the Dublin City Development Plan 2016-2022 and its Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (SFRA) not only broadens the scope of my reflection but also enhances the depth of analysis on how technological advancements can be synergized with urban planning and environmental management practices. This expanded consideration allows for a multifaceted approach towards sustainable urban development, emphasizing the critical role of innovative technologies in addressing complex urban challenges.\nRemote sensing, with its capacity to collect detailed environmental data from a distance, presents an invaluable tool for urban planners and policymakers. By facilitating a comprehensive analysis of land use changes, vegetation cover, water bodies, and urban infrastructure, remote sensing data can significantly contribute to informed decision-making processes. For Dublin, leveraging such technologies means the ability to dynamically monitor urban expansion and its impacts on flood risks, assess vulnerabilities across the urban landscape, and develop targeted strategies for flood mitigation and urban resilience.\nThis integration goes beyond traditional planning methods by enabling a proactive rather than reactive approach to urban development and environmental stewardship. The precision and timeliness of data provided by remote sensing can lead to the early identification of potential flood-prone areas, changes in land cover that may affect hydrological cycles, and the effectiveness of existing flood defense structures. Consequently, this facilitates the optimization of land use planning, infrastructure development, and environmental conservation efforts to mitigate flood risks effectively.\nFurthermore, the application of remote sensing technologies underscores the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and capacity building among urban planners, environmental scientists, and the broader community. Engaging with a diverse range of stakeholders in the interpretation and application of remote sensing data can foster a more inclusive and participatory approach to urban planning. This collaborative framework not only enhances the understanding and management of flood risks but also promotes a shared sense of responsibility and collective action towards sustainable urban development.\nMoreover, the ongoing advancement in remote sensing technologies, including higher resolution imagery, real-time data acquisition, and improved analytical tools, offers new opportunities for innovation in urban planning and environmental management. As cities like Dublin strive to align their development strategies with global sustainability goals, the integration of such technologies becomes increasingly crucial. It allows for a more nuanced understanding of urban ecosystems, the interconnections between human activities and natural processes, and the pathways towards achieving a harmonious balance between urban development and environmental preservation.\nIn summary, the reflection on integrating remote sensing technologies into Dublin’s urban planning and flood risk management efforts highlights the transformative potential of such tools in advancing sustainable urban development. It points towards a future where technology and data-driven insights become central to crafting resilient, inclusive, and sustainable urban landscapes. This expanded perspective not only enriches my understanding of the complexities involved in urban planning but also inspires a forward-looking approach to leveraging technology for the betterment of our urban environments."

    "text": "1.2 Application\n\nThroughout the week, remote sensing technology is a method of observing and analysing the Earth and its atmosphere from a distance using radio waves or other forms of electromagnetic waves. This technology enables imaging and analysis of distant targets in a non-contact manner by collecting and processing electromagnetic wave information from the Earth’s surface and atmosphere. With the development of technology, remote sensing has become an important tool in the field of geographic information science and is widely used in a number of research and practical applications(Q. Zhou 2023). In the field of urban environmental monitoring, remote sensing technology provides an efficient means of monitoring air quality, water quality and land use. Urban sprawl, traffic flow and pollution from industrial activities can be observed and analysed from the air through remote sensing technology, which helps in decision-making for urban planning and environmental protection(J. Zhou 2023).In the area of vegetation monitoring, remote sensing can be used to analyse the health, growth dynamics and coverage of plants, and by analysing reflected and absorbed electromagnetic waves of specific wavelengths, scientists are able to assess important parameters such as the biomass, water content and chlorophyll concentration of vegetation. This information is important for the optimisation of agricultural production, forestry management and ecological conservation(Adhikary et al. 2022a).Geological research has also benefited from the application of remote sensing technology, and by analysing the electromagnetic wave reflection characteristics of the earth’s surface, scientists have been able to identify different rock types, the distribution of mineral deposits and changes in topography and geomorphology. This is of great value for the exploration of mineral resources, the early warning of geological disasters and the monitoring of environmental changes(Torres Gil, Valdelamar Martínez, and Saba 2023).Agriculture is one of the areas in which remote sensing technology is most widely used. In addition to being used for assessing plant health and yield estimation, remote sensing is used to monitor irrigation needs, detect weeds and pests and make weather forecasts. This makes agricultural production more precise and efficient, helping to increase crop yields and reduce resource wastage(Adhikary et al. 2022b).\nIn addition, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technology, as an advanced remote sensing technology, has a wide range of applications. By using radar waves to penetrate the limitations of cloud cover and lighting conditions, it provides a unique perspective for surface observation. This technology is capable of acquiring high-quality image data under any weather conditions, including dense fog, cloud cover, rain and snow, as well as at night. As a result, SAR has become an important tool for geological exploration, topographic mapping, disaster monitoring and prevention, traffic surveillance, and agricultural and forest monitoring, among other fields.(Hu et al. 2022)。\nSAR systems work by transmitting and receiving microwave signals, using the returned signals to calculate the position, shape and other characteristics of objects on the ground. A key advantage of this active sensing technology is its sensitivity to the type of ground material and moisture content, allowing it to play an important role in monitoring vegetation-covered areas, urban environments and bodies of water, where SAR imagery is unique in analysing surface changes, assessing the impacts of disasters and carrying out environmental monitoring, owing to its unique imaging properties(Navalgund, Jayaraman, and Roy 2007)."

The ability to observe and analyse our planet from a distance provides a unique perspective that is not possible through ground-based observations alone. It literally allows us to see the bigger picture, providing a comprehensive understanding of large-scale environmental patterns, urban development and even climate change.\nRemote sensing is interdisciplinary in nature. It’s not just a tool for geographers or environmental scientists; it integrates physics, engineering, environmental science and even policy-making. This integration demonstrates the collaborative effort required to address complex global issues. For example, remote sensing data can inform policies on urban planning, agricultural practices and disaster management, making it a critical tool for sustainable development.\nAnother aspect is the rapid evolution of remote sensing technology. With innovations such as high-resolution imagery and real-time data analysis, the potential applications of this technology are expanding at an incredible rate."

This technology, with its ability to observe and analyse our planet from afar, offers a unique perspective that ground-based observations simply cannot match. It’s like having a bird’s-eye view of the world, which opens up a whole new dimension in comprehending large-scale environmental patterns, urban sprawl, and the intricate dynamics of climate change.\nWhat strikes me the most is how remote sensing serves as a bridge across various disciplines. It’s not confined to the realm of geography or environmental science; rather, it embodies a synergy of physics, engineering, environmental science, and even policy-making. This multidisciplinary approach highlights the collective effort needed to tackle the complex challenges our world faces today. For instance, the data derived from remote sensing technologies play a pivotal role in shaping policies related to urban planning, optimizing agricultural practices, and enhancing disaster management strategies. It underscores the technology’s indispensability in driving sustainable development forward.\nThe rapid advancement in remote sensing technologies is nothing short of astonishing. Innovations such as high-resolution imagery and the capability for real-time data analysis are broadening the horizons of its applications at an unprecedented pace. These advancements are not only improving our current capabilities but are also paving the way for new possibilities in monitoring and managing the Earth’s resources more effectively.

    "text": "4.3 Reflection\n\nIncorporating the application of remote sensing technologies into the context of the Dublin City Development Plan 2016-2022 and its Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (SFRA) not only broadens the scope of my reflection but also enhances the depth of analysis on how technological advancements can be synergized with urban planning and environmental management practices. This expanded consideration allows for a multifaceted approach towards sustainable urban development, emphasizing the critical role of innovative technologies in addressing complex urban challenges.\nRemote sensing, with its capacity to collect detailed environmental data from a distance, presents an invaluable tool for urban planners and policymakers. By facilitating a comprehensive analysis of land use changes, vegetation cover, water bodies, and urban infrastructure, remote sensing data can significantly contribute to informed decision-making processes. For Dublin, leveraging such technologies means the ability to dynamically monitor urban expansion and its impacts on flood risks, assess vulnerabilities across the urban landscape, and develop targeted strategies for flood mitigation and urban resilience.\nThis integration goes beyond traditional planning methods by enabling a proactive rather than reactive approach to urban development and environmental stewardship. The precision and timeliness of data provided by remote sensing can lead to the early identification of potential flood-prone areas, changes in land cover that may affect hydrological cycles, and the effectiveness of existing flood defense structures. Consequently, this facilitates the optimization of land use planning, infrastructure development, and environmental conservation efforts to mitigate flood risks effectively.\nFurthermore, the application of remote sensing technologies underscores the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and capacity building among urban planners, environmental scientists, and the broader community. Engaging with a diverse range of stakeholders in the interpretation and application of remote sensing data can foster a more inclusive and participatory approach to urban planning. This collaborative framework not only enhances the understanding and management of flood risks but also promotes a shared sense of responsibility and collective action towards sustainable urban development. Moreover, the ongoing advancement in remote sensing technologies, including higher resolution imagery, real-time data acquisition, and improved analytical tools, offers new opportunities for innovation in urban planning and environmental management. As cities like Dublin strive to align their development strategies with global sustainability goals, the integration of such technologies becomes increasingly crucial. It allows for a more nuanced understanding of urban ecosystems, the interconnections between human activities and natural processes, and the pathways towards achieving a harmonious balance between urban development and environmental preservation.\nIn summary, the reflection on integrating remote sensing technologies into Dublin’s urban planning and flood risk management efforts highlights the transformative potential of such tools in advancing sustainable urban development. It points towards a future where technology and data-driven insights become central to crafting resilient, inclusive, and sustainable urban landscapes. This expanded perspective not only enriches my understanding of the complexities involved in urban planning but also inspires a forward-looking approach to leveraging technology for the betterment of our urban environments."

    "text": "5.3 Applications\n\n5.3.1 General Applications\nGEE一直是遥感大数据处理的关注焦点。GEE是一个基于云的平台，可使用Google的云在全球范围内并行处理地理空间数据。GEE是一个免费的云平台，承载着超过40年的PB规模的遥感数据，例如Landsat，MODIS，美国国家海洋和大气管理局高级超高分辨率辐射计（NOAA AVHRR），Sentinel 1、2、3和5- P; 和高级陆地观测卫星（ALOS）数据(Aghamiri et al., n.d.)。 GEE还包括气候-天气和地球物理数据集。还提供其他现成的产品，例如增强植被指数（EVI）和归一化植被指数（NDVI）。除了可以使用大量原始遥感图像存储库之外，用户还可以访问GEE数据目录中的预处理图像，云去除图像和镶嵌图像 (Ritika, n.d.)。\n\n\n\n\n\nA summary of the algorithms and capabilities available in code editor-Google Earth Engine, Author: (Tamiminia et al. 2020)\n\n\n\n\nGEE还提供了其他与用户交互的方式。资源管理器是一个简单的Web应用程序，用于数据目录浏览，可视化和基本分析，允许用户运行简单的分析。下面是一些实际上的应用。\n\n\n\n\n\nGEE in Different Applications, Author: (Tamiminia et al. 2020)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.2 GEE和数据类型\n在学术界对于GEE的使用中，大部分都是采用了光学图，其原因很大程度上要归功于Landsat影像的40年免费存档，光学遥感数据仍然是最常用的数据源。GEE数据目录提供了1972年至今的光学卫星图像，使研究人员能够进行地球监测研究(Pham-Duc et al. 2023)。此外，GEE用户的广泛应用表明，光学图像对于非远程传感专家来说更易于处理和解释。这就是为什么GEE在广泛的科学领域中遍及全球的原因之一。同时，SAR和光学卫星数据的结合能够帮助研究人员解决云层遮挡等问题。特别是在热带地区，由于云层的持续覆盖以及森林火灾等情况，光学图像的效能会受到极大影响。因此，结合光学和SAR数据可以提高分类的准确性，并提供更多信息来监测地表变化(Lea et al. 2023).\n\n\n5.3.3 GEE和传感器类型\nLandsat被认为是GEE中重要的遥感数据源，因为它提供了地球表面的连续图像。Landsat 9卫星将于2020年发射，目的是继续执行Landsat计划在监测地球资源方面的关键作用。可以在区域和全球范围内进行长期的土地覆盖变化研究(Pham-Duc et al. 2023)。\nSentinel-1是卫星图像的另一个流行来源，并且取得了非常准确的分类结果。Sentinel-1由两颗卫星组成，分别由2014年和2016年发射的Sentinel-1A和Sentinel 1-B组成，空间分辨率为10 m，重访时间为6天(Arias Cuenca 2023)。它配备了双极化C波段SAR传感器，可以在全天候，白天和夜晚的情况下提供数据。Sentinel-2任务包括两颗卫星组成的星座，即Sentinel-2A（于2015年发射）和Sentinel-2B（于2017年发射），它们提供空间分辨率为10 m，20 m和60 m的光学图像，以及大约5天的时间分辨率(Xu, Heremans, and Somers 2022; Lechner et al. 2022)\n中分辨率成像光谱仪（MODIS）于1999年在Terra卫星上发射，并在2002年在Aqua卫星上发射。研究人员可以在1天的重访时间访问36个光谱带和三种变化的空间分辨率（250 m，500 m和1 km）的GEE中的MODIS数据。即使MODIS的空间分辨率很低，它的高时间分辨率也使研究人员可以监视短期和长期的全球环境变化（动力学）(Wu and Xiong 2020)。\n\n\n5.3.4 遥感数据分析\n\n5.3.4.1 机器学习技术\n机器学习是人工智能的一个子集，它处理算法设计以训练模型以做出决策或预测。机器学习方法可分为两大类：参数化和非参数化。参数化机器学习算法使用固定数量的参数或假设。机器学习方法已被有效地用于遥感数据处理。分类，聚类，回归和降维是机器学习算法的四个主要分析类别(Shaveta 2023)。 回归是一种监督式机器学习方法，旨在基于一组协变量来估计或预测输出变量。线性回归的另一个积极方面是它的快速计算速度，这是地理大数据分析中的重要因素(“Google Earth Engine and Machine Learning for Earth Monitoring,” n.d.)。同时MLR模型在预测过程中会处理因变量和自变量之间的非线性关系。\n\n\n5.3.4.2 其他GEE图像处理功能\nGEE提供了多种图像处理工具，适用于遥感数据的分析。这些工具涵盖了时间序列分析、特征提取、图像的彩色合成以及图像预处理等方面，主要针对卫星图像，而不是基于机器学习的方法(“Google Earth Engine and Machine Learning for Earth Monitoring,” n.d.)。随着地球表面快速变化，卫星图像的时间序列分析变得至关重要，它帮助追踪趋势、监测变化并发展预测模型。GEE因其能处理高分辨率或大量数据而在多项研究中被用于此类分析，特别是在监测地表变化方面表现出色。特征提取技术，通过分析图像的光谱和几何属性，帮助识别图像中的区域关系，这对于资源节约和信息保留非常关键(Pham-Duc et al. 2023)。另外，GEE的视觉解释工具在土地监测研究中广泛应用，通过色彩合成图像提取关键信息。此外，GEE的图像预处理功能支持图像镶嵌、云层处理和错误检测，尽管云覆盖是处理光学数据时的主要挑战，但GEE提供了有效的工具和算法以支持这些工作(Lea et al. 2023)。"

    "section": "5.4 Reflection",
    "text": "5.4 Reflection\nGEE已经成为最受欢迎的地理空间和大数据分析平台之一。尽管如此，仍然有扩展的空间。特别是，GEE为地理空间处理提供了一个易于使用且免费的平台，但是用户无法控制可能导致某些计算问题的并行处理环境的细节。这意味着GEE管理着计算的各个方面，例如源分配，并行性，数据分发和重试，而用户无法影响自己动手（DIY）并行化（Gorelick et al.，2017）。通常，GEE限制可分为三大类：计算，数据集和算法。 值得注意的是，GEE具有一些计算限制，包括时间，内存和存储。关于时限问题，GEE中有两种计算模式：按需和批处理。前者处理的运行次数有限，而后者可以在代码运行时运行。因此，将批处理用于大量计算是合理的，因为任务以按需模式运行。此外，在某些情况下，对大量数据集执行处理时，GEE可能会遇到内存问题。尽管脚本可能是没有逻辑错误的有效JavaScript，但是有时用户在并行化和执行计算时会遇到内部错误，例如内部服务错误，计算超时，超出用户内存限制以及过多的并发聚合。这些错误称为缩放错误，当输出太大，数量太多或计算时间很长时，可能会发生。关于存储，用户可以将结果保存在Google云端硬盘，Google云和GEE资产中。但是，应考虑将有限的250 GB容量用于在GEE资产中保存数据。GEE表资产的大小和形状也有一些限制。 尽管GEE包含大量的图像档案，但是对于许多研究而言，历史和高分辨率数据的价值有限。具体而言，在GEE中有13％的研究专注于灾难测绘，尤其是干旱监测。GEE还可以提供可靠的信息来监视其他灾难，例如地震和洪水图。此外，GEE当前提供高分辨率图像，包括RGB和多光谱集合中的国家农业图像计划（NAIP）和Planet Skysat。美国NAIP提供1 m分辨率的航拍图像数据。自2003-2018年以来，这些图像在GEE中可用，周期为3年和5年。从2014年到2016年，GEE还提供RGB和多光谱/平移集合的Planet Skysat影像。RGB影像以0.8 m分辨率（离地面最低图像1 m）提供，而R，G，B，近红外波段具有约2 m的分辨率，泛波段具有0.8分辨率（离最低点为1 m）。因此，需要高空间和时间分辨率的图像。 到目前为止，Sentinel-1图像是GEE中唯一可用的SAR数据；然而，通过增加从ALOS PALSAR收集的L波段数据来满足多种应用的需求，需要更长的波长，例如作物制图，开辟了新的途径。与具有中等渗透能力并主要与树冠上部相互作用的C波段相比，L波段具有更深的渗透能力并且可以与茎和枝相互作用，因此使其在多种应用中具有优势。 在GEE中，新算法的实现可能具有挑战性。在过去的几年中，由于深度学习方法与传统的机器学习工具相比具有优越性，因此在遥感领域受到了广泛的关注（Mahdianpari et al.，2018b ; Mohammadimanesh et al.，2019b ; Nogueira et al.， 2017，Rezaee et al.，2018，Sun & Wang，2018，Zhang et al.，2018，Zhu et al.，2017）。特别是深度神经网络已广泛用于图像分类任务，并且在分类精度方面显示出令人鼓舞的结果（Maggiori et al.，2016）。但是，GEE尚不直接支持深度学习算法。在深度学习方面，选择开源框架至关重要。TensorFlow是开源深度学习框架中最受欢迎的框架，例如Caffe，Microsoft CNTK，MXNet，Facebook Torch，Deeplearning4j and Theano（Zhu et al.，2017）。尽管尚不直接支持深度学习分类器，但GEE最近已与TensorFlow链接（自2019年9月起）。尤其是，用户现在可以访问软件包，从而允许他们与TensorFlow保存在Google AI平台上的模型格式进行交互（DeLancey et al.，2020）。GEE API提供了以TFRecord格式导入/导出图像，训练和测试数据集的机会。TFRecord格式可以处理大量数据，它允许用户以批量处理方式运行分类器，而无需存储所有数据。因此，此功能无疑可以应对大数据分析中的挑战。 根据GEE在基于像素的分类中的最佳性能，结果表明大多数研究已使用基于像素的方法完成。然而，这将引起在大面积上寻找高质量参考数据的问题。此外，如果成功实施了复杂的无监督分类算法，则GEE可能更具说服力。例如，目前GEE代码编辑器仅支持K-means，X-means，LVQ和Cobweb。由于遥感图像的固有特性（例如非正态分布数据）和混合像素的存在，实现复杂的算法（例如ISODATA，模糊K均值，概率K均值和基于内核的聚类方法）至关重要。 总体而言，与基于矢量的处理相比，GEE被证明更适合图像分析。此外，由于使用多个CPU进行处理，因此难以完成基于像素的像素空间关系的分析。此外，图像分割和水文建模选项受到限制。因此，近年来建议对基于对象的图像分析，重型矢量运算以及提供高分辨率卫星图像进行改进。"
