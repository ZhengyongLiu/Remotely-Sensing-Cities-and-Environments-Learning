## **Knowledge From the Lecture**

::: {style="text-align: justify;"}

Google Earth Engine is a cloud-based platform provided by Google for online visual computation and analysis of large amounts of global-scale geoscience data (especially satellite data). It is characterised by allowing large-scale geospatial analyses, running very fast, having code that runs on the client side, and storing the data on the server.

### Raster and vector data in GEE

1.  Raster data, called "Image", has bands.
2.  Vector data, called "Feature", has geometry and a dictionary of properties.ã€‚

### Image scaling in GEE

1.  Refers to the resolution of the image, i.e. the actual ground distance represented by each pixel.
2.  GEE automatically selects the appropriate zoom level based on the analysis requirements.

### Projection in GEE

GEE supports a variety of projections, including Mercator projection, Albers projection, and isometric cylindrical projection. The user can select the appropriate projection for analysis.

### How to use GEE

```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width='110%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='How to use GEE, Source: <a href="https://earthengine.google.com/platform/">Google Earth Engine</a>'}
knitr::include_graphics('Figure/Week_6/ How to use GEE.png')
```

### Operations that can be performed in GEE

1.  Geometric operations: e.g. spatial operations, joins (Joins), region statistics (e.g. average temperature of a neighbourhood), filtering of images or specific values.
2.  Machine learning, both supervised and unsupervised, deep learning using TensorFlow, exploring relationships between variables.
3.  Applications/outputs: online graphs, scalable geospatial applications using GEE data

### Reduce the Image in GEE

Reducing the image by region and reducing the image by neighbour are both functions that are used to regionalise or neighbourhoodise an image. The main difference between them is:

1.  Reducing the image by region operates on the image according to a specified region. Each region can be any shape and can overlap.

2.  Reducing the image by neighbour is to operate on the image according to the specified neighbourhood. The neighbourhood of each pixel is the pixels within a certain range around it. 

## **Practical**

### Compare with RGB & NDVI

```{r, echo=FALSE}
htmltools::tags$iframe(style = "height:400px; width:100%", src = "https://ee-liulzy1999.projects.earthengine.app/view/rgb--ndvi-roller-shutter")
```

[Compare with RGB & NDVI](https://ee-liulzy1999.projects.earthengine.app/view/rgb--ndvi-roller-shutter) Slide the slider to see the changes in RGB and NDVI.

### PCA Analysis

Selecting a region, it first normalizes the image bands, calculates the covariance matrix, extracts the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and then projects the image data into the principal component space. Finally, it displays the first principal component of the PCA result on the map.

## **Applications**
GEE has been the focus of attention in remote sensing big data processing.GEE is a cloud-based platform for parallel processing of geospatial data globally using Google's cloud.GEE is a free cloud-based platform hosting more than 40 years of data[@aghamiri]. GEE also includes climate-weather and geophysical datasets. Other off-the-shelf products such as the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and the Normalised Vegetation Index (NDVI) are also available. In addition to having access to a large repository of raw remote sensing imagery, users can access pre-processed imagery, cloud removal imagery and mosaics in the GEE data catalogue[@ritika].

The wide range of applications by GEE users shows that optical images are easier to process and interpret for non-remote sensing experts. This is one of the reasons why GEE has a global reach in a wide range of scientific fields. At the same time, the combination of SAR and optical satellite data can help researchers to solve problems such as cloud cover. Especially in the tropics, the efficacy of optical images can be greatly affected due to continuous cloud cover and situations such as forest fires. Therefore, combining optical and SAR data can improve the accuracy of classification and provide more information to monitor surface changes.[@lea2023].

Landsat is considered an important source of remote sensing data in the GEE, as it provides a continuous image of the Earth's surface.The Landsat 9 satellite will be launched in 2020 with the aim of continuing the Landsat programme's key role in monitoring the Earth's resources. Long-term land cover change studies can be carried out on a regional and global scale[@pham-duc2023].

Sentinel-1 is another popular source of satellite imagery and has achieved very accurate classification results.Sentinel-1 consists of two satellites, Sentinel-1A and Sentinel 1-B, which were launched in 2014 and 2016, respectively, with a spatial resolution of 10 m and a revisit time of 6 days[@ariascuenca2023]. It is equipped with a dual-polarised C-band SAR sensor that provides data in all-weather, day and night conditions. Sentinel-2A (launched in 2015) and Sentinel-2B (launched in 2017), which provide spatially resolved 10 m, 20 m and 60 m optical images, and temporal resolution of about 5 days[@xu2022; @lechner2022].

The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) was launched on the Terra satellite in 1999 and on the Aqua satellite in 2002. Researchers can access MODIS data in GEE in 36 spectral bands and at three varying spatial resolutions (250 m, 500 m, and 1 km) at 1-day revisit times[@wu2020].

GEE provides a wide range of image processing tools suitable for the analysis of remotely sensed data. These tools cover time series analysis, feature extraction, colour compositing of images and image preprocessing, mainly for satellite images, rather than machine learning-based methods[@googlee]. With the rapid changes in the Earth's surface, time-series analysis of satellite imagery has become critical, helping to track trends, monitor changes and develop predictive models.GEE has been used for such analyses in a number of studies because of its ability to handle high resolution or large amounts of data, and is particularly good at monitoring changes in the land surface. Feature extraction techniques, by analysing spectral and geometric attributes of images, help to identify regional relationships in images, which is critical for resource conservation and information retention[@pham-duc2023]. In addition, GEE's visual interpretation tools are widely used in land monitoring studies to extract key information from colour composite images. In addition, GEE's image pre-processing capabilities support image mosaicing, cloud processing and error detection, and although cloud coverage is a major challenge when working with optical data, GEE provides effective tools and algorithms to support these tasks[@lea2023].

## **Reflection**


Reflecting on the past week's immersion in Google Earth Engine (GEE), I've traversed a transformative path in remote sensing, gaining invaluable insights into both the tool's technical nuances and its broad environmental applications. My exploration delved into GEE's adept handling of geospatial data, particularly the enlightening nuances of image reduction techniques. Understanding the distinctions between region-based and neighbor-based reductions was a revelation, showcasing GEE's ability to transform complex data into insightful, actionable knowledge.

This intellectual journey illuminated the vast interdisciplinary potential of remote sensing, emphasizing how integrating diverse data types can lead to a more nuanced understanding of our planet's environmental systems. Such comprehensive analysis not only improves environmental evaluations but also contributes to a holistic grasp of Earth's complexities, underpinning sustainable solutions to ecological challenges.

The week was a fusion of learning, discovery, and enhanced appreciation for remote sensing's pivotal role in environmental science. It reinforced my resolve to utilize technology for sustainable environmental stewardship, recognizing GEE's profound capabilities to analyze and visualize intricate geospatial datasets. This experience has deepened my commitment to using innovative tools like GEE for advanced environmental monitoring, highlighting the importance of technological engagement in addressing today's ecological issues.
