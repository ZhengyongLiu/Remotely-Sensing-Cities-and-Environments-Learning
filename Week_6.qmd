## **Knowledge From the Lecture**

::: {style="text-align: justify;"}
Google Earth Engine is a cloud-based platform provided by Google for online visual computation and analysis of large amounts of global-scale geoscience data (especially satellite data). It is characterised by allowing large-scale geospatial analyses, running very fast, having code that runs on the client side, and storing the data on the server.

### Raster and vector data in GEE

1.  Raster data, called "Image", has bands.
2.  Vector data, called "Feature", has geometry and a dictionary of properties.。

### Image scaling in GEE

1.  Refers to the resolution of the image, i.e. the actual ground distance represented by each pixel.
2.  GEE automatically selects the appropriate zoom level based on the analysis requirements.

### Projection in GEE

GEE supports a variety of projections, including Mercator projection, Albers projection, and isometric cylindrical projection. The user can select the appropriate projection for analysis.

knitr::include_graphics('Figure/Week_6/ How to use GEE.png')
```

### Operations that can be performed in GEE

1.  Geometric operations: e.g. spatial operations, joins (Joins), region statistics (e.g. average temperature of a neighbourhood), filtering of images or specific values.
2.  Machine learning, both supervised and unsupervised, deep learning using TensorFlow, exploring relationships between variables.
3.  Applications/outputs: online graphs, scalable geospatial applications using GEE data

### Reduce the Image in GEE

Reducing the image by region and reducing the image by neighbour are both functions that are used to regionalise or neighbourhoodise an image. The main difference between them is:

1.  Reducing the image by region operates on the image according to a specified region. Each region can be any shape and can overlap. The function performs the specified computation on all pixels within each region and returns a new image containing the statistics of the region.

2.  Reducing the image by neighbour is to operate on the image according to the specified neighbourhood. The neighbourhood of each pixel is the pixels within a certain range around it. This function performs the specified computation on each pixel and all pixels within its neighbourhood, and returns an image containing the pixel's new value.

### Linear Regression & Join in GEE (暂时写不出来)

## **Practical**

### Compare with RGB & NDVI

```{r, echo=FALSE}
htmltools::tags$iframe(style = "height:600px; width:100%", src = "https://ee-liulzy1999.projects.earthengine.app/view/rgb--ndvi-roller-shutter")
```

[Compare with RGB & NDVI](https://ee-liulzy1999.projects.earthengine.app/view/rgb--ndvi-roller-shutter) Slide the slider to see the changes in RGB and NDVI.

### PCA Analysis

Selecting a region, it first normalizes the image bands, calculates the covariance matrix, extracts the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and then projects the image data into the principal component space. Finally, it displays the first principal component of the PCA result on the map.

## **Applications**

### General Applications

GEE has been the focus of attention in remote sensing big data processing.GEE is a cloud-based platform for parallel processing of geospatial data globally using Google's cloud.GEE is a free cloud-based platform hosting more than 40 years of petabyte-sized remote sensing data, such as Landsat, MODIS, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Advanced Ultra-High Resolution Radiometer (NOAA AVHRR), Sentinel 1, 2, 3, and 5-P; and Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) data[@aghamiri]. GEE also includes climate-weather and geophysical datasets. Other off-the-shelf products such as the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and the Normalised Vegetation Index (NDVI) are also available. In addition to having access to a large repository of raw remote sensing imagery, users can access pre-processed imagery, cloud removal imagery and mosaics in the GEE data catalogue[@ritika].

### GEE and data types

Much of the academic use of GEE has been optical, thanks in large part to the 40-year free archive of Landsat imagery, and optical remote sensing data is still the most commonly used data source.The GEE data catalogue provides optical satellite imagery from 1972 to the present day, allowing researchers to conduct Earth monitoring studies[@pham-duc2023]. In addition, the wide range of applications by GEE users shows that optical images are easier to process and interpret for non-remote sensing experts. This is one of the reasons why GEE has a global reach in a wide range of scientific fields. At the same time, the combination of SAR and optical satellite data can help researchers to solve problems such as cloud cover. Especially in the tropics, the efficacy of optical images can be greatly affected due to continuous cloud cover and situations such as forest fires. Therefore, combining optical and SAR data can improve the accuracy of classification and provide more information to monitor surface changes.[@lea2023].

### GEE和传感器类型

Landsat is considered an important source of remote sensing data in the GEE, as it provides a continuous image of the Earth's surface.The Landsat 9 satellite will be launched in 2020 with the aim of continuing the Landsat programme's key role in monitoring the Earth's resources. Long-term land cover change studies can be carried out on a regional and global scale[@pham-duc2023].

Sentinel-1 is another popular source of satellite imagery and has achieved very accurate classification results.Sentinel-1 consists of two satellites, Sentinel-1A and Sentinel 1-B, which were launched in 2014 and 2016, respectively, with a spatial resolution of 10 m and a revisit time of 6 days[@ariascuenca2023]. It is equipped with a dual-polarised C-band SAR sensor that provides data in all-weather, day and night conditions.The Sentinel-2 mission consists of a constellation of two satellites, Sentinel-2A (launched in 2015) and Sentinel-2B (launched in 2017), which provide spatially resolved 10 m, 20 m and 60 m optical images, and temporal resolution of about 5 days[@xu2022; @lechner2022].

The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) was launched on the Terra satellite in 1999 and on the Aqua satellite in 2002. Researchers can access MODIS data in GEE in 36 spectral bands and at three varying spatial resolutions (250 m, 500 m, and 1 km) at 1-day revisit times. Even though MODIS has a low spatial resolution, its high temporal resolution allows researchers to monitor short- and long-term global environmental change (dynamics)[@wu2020].

### Remote sensing data analysis

#### Machine learning techniques

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that deals with the design of algorithms to train models to make decisions or predictions. Machine learning methods can be divided into two broad categories: parametric and non-parametric. Parametric machine learning algorithms use a fixed number of parameters or assumptions. Machine learning methods have been effectively used for remote sensing data processing. Classification, clustering, regression and dimensionality reduction are the four main categories of analysis for machine learning algorithms[@shaveta2023]. Regression is a supervised machine learning method designed to estimate or predict output variables based on a set of covariates. Another positive aspect of linear regression is its fast computational speed, which is an important factor in geographic big data analysis[@googlee]. Also the MLR model deals with the non-linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables in the prediction process.

#### Other GEE image processing functions

GEE provides a wide range of image processing tools suitable for the analysis of remotely sensed data. These tools cover time series analysis, feature extraction, colour compositing of images and image preprocessing, mainly for satellite images, rather than machine learning-based methods[@googlee]. With the rapid changes in the Earth's surface, time-series analysis of satellite imagery has become critical, helping to track trends, monitor changes and develop predictive models.GEE has been used for such analyses in a number of studies because of its ability to handle high resolution or large amounts of data, and is particularly good at monitoring changes in the land surface. Feature extraction techniques, by analysing spectral and geometric attributes of images, help to identify regional relationships in images, which is critical for resource conservation and information retention[@pham-duc2023]. In addition, GEE's visual interpretation tools are widely used in land monitoring studies to extract key information from colour composite images. In addition, GEE's image pre-processing capabilities support image mosaicing, cloud processing and error detection, and although cloud coverage is a major challenge when working with optical data, GEE provides effective tools and algorithms to support these tasks[@lea2023].

On the algorithmic side, there are challenges in implementing new algorithms, especially deep learning models. Although GEE has recently established a connection to TensorFlow, enabling users to interact with models stored on the Google AI platform, it does not directly support deep learning classifiers. Most research has used pixel-based classification methods and there is a need for better support for complex unsupervised classification algorithms as well as improvements in object-based image analysis, heavy vector manipulation, and the availability of high-resolution satellite imagery[@nia].

The exploration extended beyond the fundamental technicalities of GEE's raster and vector data handling; it ventured into the practical applications and profound implications of this powerful tool in understanding and interacting with our planet.

The nuanced understanding of image reduction techniques---distinguishing between region-based and neighbor-based reductions---was particularly revelatory. It highlighted GEE's nuanced capacity to distill vast amounts of geospatial data into actionable insights. This aspect of GEE not only enhances its analytical precision but also expands its utility across various research and operational contexts, enabling a more targeted and efficient analysis of environmental phenomena.

The enlightening exploration of GEE's vast capabilities has significantly broadened my perspective, revealing the interdisciplinary potential of remote sensing technology. It's fascinating to see how the integration of various data types---from climate variables to topographical features---can offer a more comprehensive understanding of environmental dynamics. This integrative approach not only enhances the accuracy of environmental assessments but also fosters a more holistic understanding of our planet's intricate systems.

The reflective journey through this week has been a blend of learning, discovery, and inspiration. It has fortified my appreciation for the critical role of remote sensing in environmental science and its potential to inform and inspire sustainable interventions. The insights gained are not merely academic; they resonate with the pressing need for innovative solutions to global environmental challenges. As I look forward to the continuation of this academic journey, I am motivated by the potential to contribute meaningfully to our collective understanding and stewardship of the Earth, leveraging the powerful capabilities of GEE to illuminate the path toward a sustainable future.

This experiential learning has not only enriched my technical proficiency but also deepened my commitment to leveraging technology in pursuit of environmental sustainability. The profound capabilities of GEE---to process, analyze, and visualize complex geospatial datasets---offer a compelling glimpse into the future of environmental monitoring and analysis. Embracing this technology's potential can revolutionize our approach to confronting and mitigating the pressing environmental challenges of our time.
