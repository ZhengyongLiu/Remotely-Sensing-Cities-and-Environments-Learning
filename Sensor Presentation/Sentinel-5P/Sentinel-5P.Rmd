### Introduction of Sentinel-5p
.pull-left[
  The **Sentinel-5P satellite**, part of the European Space Agency's (ESA) Copernicus program, is characterized by the following features: 
1. **Air Quality Monitoring**: Equipped with advanced instruments like TROPOMI (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument).

2. **High resolution and wide coverage**: Sentinel-5P is capable of global coverage with a spatial resolution of 7 x 3.5 kilometres.

3. **Data transmission and processing**: Sentinel-5P uses a high-speed data link for fast data transmission.
