### Introduction of Sentinel-5p
.pull-left[
  The **Sentinel-5P satellite**, part of the European Space Agency's (ESA) Copernicus program, is characterized by the following features: 
1. **Air Quality Monitoring**: Equipped with advanced instruments like TROPOMI (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument).

2. **High resolution and wide coverage**: Sentinel-5P is capable of global coverage with a spatial resolution of 7 x 3.5 kilometres.

3. **Data transmission and processing**: Sentinel-5P uses a high-speed data link for fast data transmission.

### Additional Feature - Calibration Subsystem
.pull-left[
- **Calibration Subsystem (CAS)**: Each telescope of the Sentinel-5 instrument is equipped with a CAS for in-orbit calibration.
- **Function**: Injects different calibration signals.
- **Methods of Calibration**:
  - **Internal Calibration Source**: Uses a drive-injection mirror.
  - **Solar Calibration Measurements**: Employs a diffusion element.
- **Location**: Positioned before the first optical component of the telescope.
- **Purpose**: Facilitates calibration of the instrument's entire optical path.
