### Correction

#### Geometric Correction

::: {style="text-align: justify;"}
Geometric correction is the basis of image correction and addresses image distortion due to sensor and other factors. The goal of this correction is to make the image conform to the selected map projection system, adjusting the geometry of the entire image by modelling the relationship between control points (points with known geographic coordinates) on the image and the image coordinates.

#### Atmospheric Correction

::: {style="text-align: justify;"}
Atmospheric corrections are essential to address distortions and inaccuracies in remotely sensed images caused by variations in the Earth's atmosphere, sensor angles, and terrain. Several different correction methods were learned in class: **Relative Atmospheric Correction**, **Pseudo-Invariant Correction**, **Absolute Atmospheric Correction**, and **Empirical Line Correction**.
:::

The different methods and characteristics of atmospheric correction have been summarised in the table below:

| Method               | Key Steps                                                     | Feature                                             |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Relative**         | Spectrally stable landmarks, linear relations, band operation | Consistency between images                          |
| **Absolute**         | Complex models for atmospheric effects, surface reflectance   | Precise, accurate surface information               |
| **Pseudo-Invariant** | High-quality reference, PIF, linear regression                | Stable reference points, reduce atmospheric effects |
| **Empirical Line**   | Ground reflectance, average DN values, linear regression      | Utilizes ground data for satellite correction       |

#### Radiometric Correction

::: {style="text-align: justify;"}
The role of radiometric correction in adjusting the pixel values of satellite imagery to accurately reflect the radiation at the Earth's surface has been investigated. The main objective of radiometric correction is to convert the raw digital numbers (DN) acquired into physically meaningful units such as radiance or reflectance. This conversion is critical because DN values are arbitrary and can vary between sensors, acquisitions and platforms, making it difficult to consistently compare and analyse data. By converting DN values to radiance or reflectance, radiometric correction enables quantitative measurements and meaningful comparisons between different images and sensors.

#### Reflection of Collerallation

::: {style="text-align: justify;"}
In the course of study, certain questions arise as to when atmospheric corrections are needed and whether or not the images we buy or otherwise acquire have been atmospherically corrected. In layman's terms, if we need to use an image that truly reflects the Sun's radiation for quantitative inversion or to obtain information about the Earth, accurately identify features, etc., then we need to make an atmospheric correction. When we buy an image, the description document says that it is radiometrically corrected. In fact, this radiometric correction refers to the coarse radiometric correction, which is just a systematic atmospheric correction, which has the same meaning as the systematic geometric correction.

At the moment there are many models and methods on the market, since there are how many methods, then there is the problem of method selection. Here is a summary for reference:

1.  if it is a fine quantitative study, then choose the atmospheric correction method based on the radiative transfer model.
2.  if you are doing dynamic monitoring, then you can choose relative atmospheric correction or simpler methods.
3.  if the parameters are missing, there is no choice but to choose the simpler method.

### Data Join Sets/Enhancement

#### Data Join Sets

::: {style="text-align: justify;"}
An area may need more than one satellite image to be spliced, using mosaic in the R package for the two datasets to be spliced. When selecting images, try to select two images with similar time and date, due to the different date of the image, the image display is different, the reason may be (cloud cover, sunshine), need to use the image increase technique to operate.
:::

### Enhancement

#### Ratio

::: {style="text-align: justify;"}
The ratio is the difference between two spectral bands with a specific spectral response, using CampTown's data for NDVI (The Normalised Difference Vegetation Index) The Normalised Difference Vegetation Index is based on the fact that healthy and green vegetation reflects more in the near infrared but absorbs in the red wavelengths. 

This case above can be applied to other index calculations such as NDWI (Normalised Difference Water Index) and NDDI (Normalised Difference Drought Index). These are calculated using the reflectance of different objects in different light waves.
:::

#### Texture

::: {style="text-align: justify;"}
The extraction method of texture features is relatively simple, it is to use an active window to slide continuously on the image, calculate the variance, mean, maximum, minimum and the difference between the two and the information entropy in the window, etc., respectively, to form the corresponding texture image, when the spectral characteristics of the target are relatively close to each other, the texture features can play a positive role in distinguishing the target. When the spectral characteristics of the target are close, the texture features can play a positive role in distinguishing the target. After selecting the appropriate dynamic range of the data and extracting the texture features, the texture features of the image can be highlighted, which is conducive to the extraction of constructive information.

## **Application**

::: {style="text-align: justify;"}

Image correction is a key component of remote sensing technology, ensuring that the data we acquire from satellite or aerial imagery is both accurate and useful. As a student, I believe that understanding this process is critical to professional development. Radiometric correction is the first step, which adjusts image data to correct for errors due to sensor noise, response variations, or atmospheric conditions. For example, the method proposed by Duan[-@duan2014] utilises standard ground objects to achieve accurate correction without relying on artificial targets. On the other hand, the method developed by Tarasenkov[-@tarasenkov2019] enhances the accuracy of atmospheric correction by taking into account the effects of radiative polarisation.

Geometric correction, on the other hand, is another key technique that ensures consistent image scale, which is essential for accurate map production and measurement. This correction helps to remove spatial distortions, align images, and even stitch multiple images into a complete view. For example, Yan et al. [-@yan2023] emphasised its importance in accurate mapping, while Özciğan et al. [-@özcihan2023b] demonstrated advances based on orthogonal images and homonymous point matching techniques, which have greatly improved the geometric accuracy of images.

Atmospheric correction is essential to ensure the accuracy and reliability of remote sensing applications by optimising the image data by correcting the effects of atmospheric disturbances. Various algorithms have been developed and evaluated to improve the performance of this correction process, such as 6S, FLAASH, DOS, etc. These techniques are not only critical for remote sensing analysis, but also have a wide range of applications in areas such as aircraft navigation and astronomical observation.

Image enhancement technology aims to improve the quality and visual effect of remote sensing images. Various methods have been proposed to enhance these images, including histogram modification, transform domain methods, and hybrid approaches. Histogram modification methods focus on modifying the histogram of the input image to achieve a more uniform distribution, resulting in better contrast improvement. Transform domain methods apply specific transforms to enhance the image in the transform domain, leading to better edge enhancement and color preservation[@wang2023]. Hybrid methods, which combine histogram modification and transform domain methods, have shown higher potential in enhancing remote sensing images[@deng2023]. These enhancement techniques are crucial for image interpretation, improving image segmentation accuracy, and facilitating downstream tasks.

## **Reflection**

::: {style="text-align: justify;"}
As a student diving deep into remote sensing image correction technologies, it truly broadened my knowledge and also deepened my understanding of its complexities and challenges. I realized that although these technologies are crucial for enhancing the quality of image data, implementing them is not as straightforward as it might seem. For instance, radiometric correction sounds advanced, but if we lack precise ground objects for reference, the accuracy of the whole process becomes questionable. This got me thinking about whether we need to develop more adaptive correction methods that can adjust to varying conditions.

Then there's geometric correction, which indeed seems capable of solving issues with inconsistent image proportions, but if our initial data is not of good quality, or the processing is too complex, how do we balance precision with practical feasibility? It made me realize that sometimes we might need to find a balance between ideal accuracy and operational simplicity.

When it comes to atmospheric correction, I was intrigued by the performance differences of various algorithms under specific conditions. This highlights the importance of selecting the right correction algorithm for reliable data, and also hints at the necessity for more detailed comparisons of algorithms in future research.

Regarding image enhancement technologies, while they can make images appear clearer, I also began to worry about whether these techniques might inadvertently alter some crucial features in the images. This made me recognize the need to carefully maintain the authenticity of images while pursuing visual improvements.

Overall, delving into remote sensing image correction technologies not only taught me about the importance of these techniques but also exposed the various challenges that need to be overcome in practical applications. It made me more aware that alongside technological innovation, a careful evaluation and improvement of existing methods are necessary to ensure we can enhance data quality while maintaining operational feasibility and data authenticity.
